 * When using this control with {@link FeatureFlag} the way to this in a test is as follows:
 * # Call {@link #enableForSite(FeatureFlag)} or {@link #disableForSite(FeatureFlag)}
 * # Run test code
 * # Call {@link #resetForSite(FeatureFlag)}
 * <p>
 * This also applies to the methods to set for a specific user as opposed to the site.
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, the rules {@link FeatureFlagRule} and {@link FeatureFlagUserRule} exist to assist with the usage of this
 * control.
