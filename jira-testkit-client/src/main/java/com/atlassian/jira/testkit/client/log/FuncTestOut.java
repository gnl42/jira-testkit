 * output including System.out calls in memory.  If all hell breaks loose, the extra generated output (such as exceptions
 * and so on) will be kept in memory and LOST if the process runs out of memory.
 * We need to put it in a file in this case as we go, so it's available for debugging purposes.
 * So instead of using <code>System.out.println();</code>, use <code>FuncTestOut.out.println();</code>.
