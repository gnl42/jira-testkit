     * This string should not end with .enabled or .disabled, as that will be appended automatically for you, depending
     * on whether you want to enable or disable this feature.
     * <p>
     * NB: A quick note on how the feature flags are used in code, and what they will do here:
     * <p>
     * Each feature flag has a defaultOn boolean, that determines if the feature is on or off, however this can be flip
     * by entering a certain value in JIRA.
     * <p>
     * - If defaultOn is false, we can flip the feature to enabled by adding the feature key string in JIRA: "feature key" + ".enabled", e.g. "my.feature.flag.enabled"
     * - If defaultOn is true, it can be flipped to disabled by adding the feature key string: "feature key" + ".disabled", e.g. "my.feature.flag.disabled"
     * <p>
     * All that needs to be provided here is the "feature key", ie. "my.feature"
     * <p>
     * This feature flag method of enabling/disabling code in JIRA should be preferred over using a string value on it's own
     *
     * @param featureKey the key in play that is not null or blank
     * @return a new feature flag key
